Risk Management Policy
**Purpose**
The purpose of this Risk Management Policy is to establish a structured, continuous, and repeatable approach to identifying, evaluating, mitigating, monitoring, and reporting risks to the AegisSecure Cloud Platform (ASCP). This policy ensures protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and compliance with NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 through risk-based decision-making.
**Scope**
This policy applies to:
- All ASCP components hosted in AWS GovCloud (US-East)
- All personnel with administrative, development, operational, or security responsibilities
- All systems processing, storing, or transmitting CUI
- All risks affecting confidentiality, integrity, availability, compliance, operations, or supply chain
**Roles & Responsibilities**
- **System Owner:** Maintains oversight of system-level risk posture.
- **Security Manager:** Leads risk assessments, updates the Risk Register, and tracks mitigation efforts.
- **DevSecOps Team:** Implements controls and remediations to reduce overall system risk.
- **Change Advisory Board (CAB):** Reviews risk impacts of proposed system changes.
- **Incident Response Team:** Assesses risks following security incidents or anomalies.
- **All Users:** Immediately report suspicious behavior, anomalies, or potential threats.

### **Policy Statements**
#### **1. Risk Identification**
ASCP must continuously identify risks from:
- Vulnerabilities or unpatched systems
- Cloud misconfigurations
- Third-party or supply chain exposure
- Insider threats, compromised credentials, or excessive permissions
- Software flaws or insecure development practices
- Service outages or operational failures
- CUI exposure or data integrity issues
New risks must be added to the centralized ASCP Risk Register.
#### **2. Risk Assessment**
All risks must be evaluated based on:
- **Likelihood:** Low, Medium, High
- **Impact:** Low, Medium, High
- **Overall Risk Score:** Using ASCP's standardized scoring matrix
Assessment criteria must consider:
- Impact on CUI confidentiality, integrity, and availability
- Regulatory implications (e.g., DFARS, NIST 800-171)
- Mission and business impact
- Existing or compensating controls
#### **3. Risk Mitigation**
Applicable strategies include:
- **Mitigate:** Implement security controls to reduce impact/likelihood
- **Transfer:** Shift risk via contractual terms or insurance
- **Avoid:** Remove the process or system causing the risk
- **Accept:** Acknowledge residual risk after formal review
Each mitigation effort must include:
- Owner assignment
- Timeline for completion
- Implementation tasks
- Verification and closure procedures
#### **4. Risk Acceptance**
Risk acceptance must:
- Be formally approved by the System Owner and Security Manager
- Describe residual risk and justification
- Identify compensating controls
- Include a review or expiration date
Risks involving potential CUI compromise may only be accepted with executive approval.
#### **5. Risk Monitoring**
ASCP must:
- Review the Risk Register monthly
- Conduct quarterly leadership briefings
- Integrate SIEM, GuardDuty, Inspector, and CloudTrail findings into risk scoring
- Continuously update risks as the threat landscape changes
Risk scores must be updated when:
- System changes occur
- New threats emerge
- Incidents are detected
- Controls are modified or removed
#### **6. Risk Reporting**
Reports must be generated:
- Monthly for internal leadership
- Quarterly for compliance governance
- Following any major incident or critical vulnerability
Reports must include:
- Active risks by severity
- New risks discovered
- Mitigation progress and overdue activities
- Trends in risk posture over time
#### **7. Integration with Incident Response & Change Management**
- All incidents automatically create new entries in the Risk Register.
- Normal and Emergency changes must undergo risk impact review before execution.
- Post-incident reviews must adjust risk scores and mitigation strategies.

### **Control Alignment (NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2)**
- **3.11.1–3.11.2:** Vulnerability risk considerations
- **3.12.1:** Ongoing assessments
- **3.12.2:** Security monitoring
- **3.12.3:** Control effectiveness tracking
- **3.1, 3.13, 3.14:** Access, communication, and integrity protections informed by risk
---
### **Enforcement**
Non-compliance may result in:
- Removal of privileged access
- Disciplinary action
- Incident escalation
- Contractual reporting requirements if CUI is threatened
