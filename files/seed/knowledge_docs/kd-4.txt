Audit & Logging Policy

Purpose:
Define audit logging requirements and monitoring expectations for ASCP in alignment with NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 and organizational oversight obligations.

Scope:
Applies to all systems, components, services, administrators, and users within the ASCP CUI Processing Enclave and related support environments.

Roles & Responsibilities:
• ISSM – Owns audit policy, ensures compliance.
• ISSO – Reviews logs, manages audit configurations.
• SOC – Monitors alerts, analyzes security events.
• DevSecOps – Ensures logging services and pipelines operate correctly.
• CloudOps – Maintains AWS logging integrations.
• Users – Must not disable or circumvent audit logging.

Policy Statements:
1. ASCP must generate audit logs for authentication, authorization, file uploads, CUI access, API calls, admin actions, privilege escalations, and system events.
2. Audit logging must be enabled at:
   • Application layer
   • Kubernetes/EKS layer
   • Cloud infrastructure (CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs)
   • Identity layer (Entra ID, Keycloak)
   • Database and storage layers
3. Logs must be forwarded to:
   • CloudWatch
   • Kinesis Firehose
   • Security Lake (immutable S3)
   • Enterprise SIEM (Splunk Cloud Gov)
4. All logs must be timestamped via NTP-synchronized clocks and protected from tampering.
5. Audit logs must be retained:
   • 1 year hot storage
   • 7 years immutable archive
6. SOC must continuously monitor audit logs and escalate suspicious activity.
7. ISSO must review audit events weekly and monthly, with documented results.
8. Audit logging must not store CUI content unless absolutely required; CUI snippets must be redacted or tokenized.
9. Logging pipeline failures must trigger immediate alerts and corrective action.
10. Users and administrators must not clear, alter, or disable logs.

Control Alignment:
• NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 – 3.3.1 through 3.3.8

Enforcement:
Unauthorized alteration or disabling of logging mechanisms may result in disciplinary action, access termination, and incident escalation.
