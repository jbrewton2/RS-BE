Part 3 – System Environment

[PART 3 – SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT]

Aegis Secure Systems operates ASCP within a multi-layered, multi-enclave enterprise architecture designed to enforce NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 CUI protections. ASCP resides entirely within the CUI Processing Enclave, isolated from the Enterprise IT Enclave and the Project Support Enclaves. This section includes detailed descriptions of cloud architecture, identity services, Zero Trust enforcement, Kubernetes runtime security, device compliance, SIEM pipelines, logging, monitoring, network segmentation, physical protections, personnel limitations, and enclave interrelationships.

--- ENTERPRISE SECURITY CONTEXT ---
The enterprise environment contains:
• Enterprise IT Enclave – Entra GCC High, Intune, SIEM/SOC, corporate network, email, Teams.
• CUI Processing Enclave – AWS GovCloud (US-East), EKS, RDS, S3, KMS, CloudWatch, GuardDuty, Keycloak.
• Project Enclaves – GovCloud IL2/IL4, Azure GCC High, Air-gapped labs.

--- CUI PROCESSING ENCLAVE (ASCP HOSTING) ---
AWS GovCloud VPC:
• CIDR 10.52.0.0/16 with private app, DB, endpoint, and logging subnets.
• VPC Flow Logs enabled → CloudWatch → Security Lake → SIEM.
• No IGW, no public endpoints, PrivateLink-only.

Compute Layer:
• Amazon EKS, private node groups, FIPS AMIs.
• Pod security: no privileged containers, IRSA for IAM roles, enforced CPU/memory limits.

Service Mesh:
• Istio/Envoy with mutual TLS, certificate rotation, encrypted east-west traffic.

Data Layer:
• Amazon RDS PostgreSQL with TLS-only connections, KMS encryption, audit logging, Multi-AZ.
• S3 CUI buckets with Object Lock, private endpoint access only, strict IAM policies.

--- ENTERPRISE IT ENCLAVE ---
Identity:
• Entra ID GCC High is the authoritative identity provider.
• MFA enforced (FIPS-approved).
• Conditional Access requires: device compliance, US-only, managed apps.

Endpoint Environment:
• Windows 11 Enterprise (Intune-managed), macOS Ventura+ (MDM-managed), CrowdStrike EDR.
• Device controls: USB disabled, print restrictions, full disk encryption, minimum OS versions.

Network:

Log Pipeline:
EKS → Fluent Bit → CloudWatch → Kinesis → Security Lake → Splunk Cloud Gov SIEM.
Retention:
• 1-year hot storage.
• 7-year immutable archival with S3 Object Lock.

--- PHYSICAL SECURITY ---
• GovCloud datacenters: FISMA High, US Persons only, multi-factor, guards, CCTV.
• Corporate offices: card access, visitor logs, escorts for non-cleared personnel.

--- PERSONNEL SECURITY ---
• All users must be US Persons.
• Background checks, NDAs, CUI training.
• Privileged roles use JIT access and PAWs.

--- NETWORK ARCHITECTURE ---
Zero Trust enforced through:
• Conditional Access,
• Device compliance,
• ZTNA gateway,
• mTLS within cluster,
• No internet egress from ASCP.

Ports & Protocols:
• User→ZTNA: HTTPS 443
• ZTNA→ALB: HTTPS 443
• ALB→EKS: mTLS 15012
• Pods→RDS: TLS 5432
• Pods→S3: HTTPS 443 (PrivateLink)

--- ENVIRONMENT SUMMARY ---
ASCP is fully isolated inside a hardened GovCloud enclave with strictly enforced Zero Trust policies, enterprise identity federation, controlled interconnections, extensive audit logging, strict device policies, and compliance-driven enclave segmentation.

Part 4 – System Architecture & Boundary

[PART 4 – SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE & BOUNDARY]

ASCP operates within a tightly controlled, multi-layered architecture inside the Aegis CUI Processing Enclave hosted exclusively in AWS GovCloud (US-East). This section details the full authorization boundary, trust zones, data flows, network topology, inter-service protections, boundary enforcement points, diagrams, ports/protocols, and cloud services in scope.

--- AUTHORIZATION BOUNDARY OVERVIEW ---
The ASCP authorization boundary includes:

5. SYSTEM INTERCONNECTIONS
This section documents every system interconnection for the AegisSecure Cloud Platform (ASCP), including:
Enterprise identity interconnections
Device compliance interconnections
SIEM/logging interconnections
Cloud service interconnections
Interconnections with Project Support Enclaves
Network-level connectivity

Interconnection governance
ASCP intentionally maintains a minimal interconnection footprint to reduce the attack surface and strictly control CUI flow across the enterprise.
Interconnections are segmented into:
Internal enterprise services (identity, MDM, SOC/SIEM)
CUI enclave service providers (GovCloud services)
Project-enclave consumers (metadata-only)
Administrative systems
Logging, monitoring, and evidence sources
ASCP does not connect to public SaaS tools, external partner networks, or government infrastructure directly.

PART 7 — ACCESS CONTROL (AC)
7A — Controls 3.1.1 through 3.1.11
The Access Control family (3.1) establishes a robust set of policies, controls, and technical mechanisms ensuring that only authorized users, processes, systems, and devices may access the AegisSecure Cloud Platform (ASCP) and the Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) it processes.
ASCP applies Zero Trust principles, enterprise identity federation, enclave-level RBAC, network segmentation, and strict enforcement of device compliance, encryption, session management, and boundary protections.
The controls below describe exactly how ASCP implements the 22 Access Control requirements from NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2.

3.1.1 – Limit system access to authorized users, processes, and devices
Status: Implemented
Priority: High
Control Type: Basic and Derived
ASCP Implementation
ASCP enforces strict access control using:
Identity:
All human access must originate from Entra ID GCC High, the authoritative enterprise directory.
ASCP does not accept local usernames/passwords.
Federation with Keycloak (CUI enclave IdP) ensures users assume enclave-scoped roles.
Devices:
Every device accessing ASCP must be:
Intune-managed
Fully compliant
US-based
Not jailbroken/rooted
Running approved OS versions
Non-compliant devices are automatically blocked via Conditional Access + Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA).
Processes & Services:
All ASCP microservices communicate via Istio mTLS, presenting service certificates validated by the enclave CA.
No unauthenticated pods can communicate with production services.
IAM roles are scoped per-service using IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts).
Network Enforcement:
All traffic enters through a ZTNA gateway, which enforces identity + device + risk scoring.
No direct network path exists from corporate or public Internet into the ASCP enclave.
Evidence Expected
Entra ID user list
Keycloak role mapping
MDM compliance dashboard
Istio service-mesh certificates

3.1.2 – Limit system access to types of transactions and functions authorized for users
Status: Implemented
ASCP Implementation
ASCP uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Keycloak with distinct roles:
Enforcement details
API endpoints require specific OAuth2 scopes.
UI components are dynamically rendered only for authorized roles.
Backend services validate JWT roles and scopes.
Document viewer checks both RBAC and origin device before allowing access.
Evidence
Keycloak realm export
API access logs
Reviewer/ISSO/Admin UI screenshots

3.1.3 – Control the flow of CUI in accordance with approved authorizations
Status: Implemented
ASCP Implementation
ASCP enforces strict CUI flow policies:
CUI Ingress:
Only permitted through the ASCP secure upload pipeline.
Files stored in S3 CUI buckets with Object Lock.
Virus scanning + MIME validation enforced.
CUI Processing:
OCR, parsing, heuristic scanning, and LLM analysis occur entirely in private EKS nodes.
All internal traffic is mTLS-encrypted within the mesh.
CUI Egress:
Raw CUI documents never leave the enclave.
Project enclaves receive metadata-only API responses, never full documents.
Reviewer browser downloads, clipboard actions, and print actions are blocked.
CUI Storage:
All CUI stored with AES-256 KMS CMKs.
S3 buckets enforce TLS-only access and private endpoints.
Evidence

Separation of duties exists across:
Identity Admins → manage Entra ID but cannot access ASCP CUI.
Keycloak Admins → manage RBAC but cannot deploy infrastructure.
DevSecOps → manage infrastructure and code but cannot view CUI.
SOC Analysts → view logs but cannot modify ASCP configuration.
Reviewers → view CUI but cannot access backend admin tools.
ISSO → audit logs but cannot deploy infra.
This ensures no single person can perform both administrative and operational roles for sensitive CUI workflows.
