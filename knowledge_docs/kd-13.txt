Continuous Monitoring Policy
**Purpose**
The purpose of this Continuous Monitoring Policy is to establish requirements for ongoing security monitoring, assessment, logging, and review activities that ensure the AegisSecure Cloud Platform (ASCP) maintains a strong security posture, identifies threats in real time, and complies with NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2. Continuous Monitoring (ConMon) provides ongoing awareness of vulnerabilities, indicators of compromise, and control effectiveness.
**Scope**
This policy applies to:
- All ASCP environments hosted in AWS GovCloud (US-East)
- All infrastructure components, applications, containers, databases, CI/CD pipelines, and identity systems
- All personnel with administrative, development, or security responsibilities
- All logging, SIEM, detection, and monitoring tools used to protect CUI
**Roles & Responsibilities**
- **System Owner:** Ensures continuous monitoring activities align with governance and contractual requirements.
- **Security Manager:** Oversees monitoring operations, reviews alerts, and ensures control effectiveness.
- **DevSecOps Team:** Implements monitoring agents, log pipelines, dashboards, and automated alerting.
- **Incident Response Team:** Investigates and responds to alerts and anomalies.
- **Users:** Report suspicious activity or anomalies immediately.

### **Policy Statements**
#### **1. Security Monitoring Requirements**
ASCP must continuously monitor:
- Authentication and access activity (Entra ID GCC High, Keycloak)
- Network traffic patterns and anomalies
- System integrity and configuration changes
- Vulnerability status and patch levels
- AWS GuardDuty findings and Inspector alerts
- API calls and resource actions (CloudTrail)
- Critical infrastructure health (EC2, RDS, S3, containers)
Monitoring must be active 24/7.
#### **2. Logging Requirements**
- All relevant logs must be collected, aggregated, and forwarded to a central SIEM.
- Mandatory log sources:
  - AWS CloudTrail
  - CloudWatch Logs
  - VPC Flow Logs
  - Keycloak access and admin logs
  - Application logs (API, frontend, background tasks)
  - Container logs
  - RDS PostgreSQL audit logs
- Logs must be:
  - Immutable
  - Timestamped using synchronized time sources
  - Stored in encrypted S3 with lifecycle and retention controls
  - Protected with least privilege IAM policies
#### **3. Alerting Requirements**
- Alerts must be automatically triggered for:
  - Unauthorized access attempts
  - Privilege escalations
  - CUI access anomalies
  - Data exfiltration indicators
  - Network scanning or probing
  - Misconfigurations or drift
  - Exploitable vulnerabilities
Alerts must be reviewed within defined timelines:
- Critical: within 1 hour
- High: within 4 hours
- Medium: within 24 hours
- Low: within 48 hours
#### **4. Control Effectiveness Monitoring**
ASCP must:
- Perform automated compliance checks using IaC and CSPM tools.
- Review configuration drift, baseline changes, and CIS benchmark deviations.
- Validate that encryption, backups, access controls, and network boundaries are enforced.
- Generate monthly ConMon dashboards for leadership.
#### **5. Continuous Assessment Activities**
- Weekly vulnerability scans
- Daily GuardDuty review
- Monthly access reviews
- Quarterly privilege audits and key rotation checks
- Annual penetration testing (or equivalent Red Team activity)
- Ongoing code scanning with every commit through CI/CD
#### **6. Integration with Incident Response**
- Alerts or anomalies must immediately trigger IR triage.
- Monitoring data must be available for IR analysis.
- Post-incident reviews must evaluate monitoring coverage and gaps.
#### **7. Reporting & Metrics**
ASCP must produce monthly and quarterly monitoring reports covering:
- Alert volumes and response times
- Security control drift
- Vulnerability trends
- Access anomalies
- System uptime and reliability metrics
- Compliance status for NIST 800-171 Rev 2
#### **8. Protection of Monitoring Data**
- Monitoring and logging data are considered sensitive and must be protected.
- Access to SIEM dashboards and logs requires:
  - Keycloak RBAC
  - MFA through Entra ID GCC High
- Tampering, deletion, or modification of logs is strictly prohibited.

### **Control Alignment (NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2)**
- **3.3.1 – 3.3.8:** Audit & Accountability
- **3.12.1:** Ongoing Assessments
- **3.12.2:** Security Monitoring
- **3.12.3:** Vulnerability Management
- **3.14:** System Integrity
- **3.13:** Communications Protection (monitoring of network events)
---
### **Enforcement**
Failure to comply with this policy may result in:
- Removal of privileged access
- Disciplinary action
- Mandatory retraining
- Escalation to leadership
- Reporting to contracting officials if monitoring gaps affect CUI
