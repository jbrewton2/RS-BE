Incident Response Policy

Purpose:
This Incident Response (IR) Policy establishes requirements for detecting, reporting, analyzing, containing, eradicating, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents affecting the AegisSecure Cloud Platform (ASCP). It aligns with NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 and DFARS 252.204-7012.

Scope:
Applies to all systems, networks, users, administrators, SOC personnel, DevSecOps, CloudOps, and project enclave teams with responsibilities for ASCP or the broader CUI environment.

Roles & Responsibilities:
• AO – Approves incident declarations with major business/risk impact.
• SO – Coordinates business actions and continuity during incidents.
• ISSM – Leads incident response governance and DFARS 7012 reporting.
• ISSO – Coordinates technical response, documentation, and evidence preservation.
• SOC – Executes detection, triage, analysis, response, and escalation.
• DevSecOps – Provides technical response support; restores services post-incidents.
• CloudOps – Provides AWS GovCloud-level support for incident containment.
• Users – Must immediately report suspected incidents.

Policy Statements:
1. Incident Categories:
   ASCP classifies incidents as:
   • Unauthorized access attempts
   • Suspicious authentication events
   • Malware infections or blocked malware events
   • CUI exposure or attempted exfiltration
   • Privilege escalation attempts
   • Container runtime compromises
   • Misconfigurations that expose ASCP assets
   • Denial-of-service or resource exhaustion attempts
   • Cloud service abnormalities (GuardDuty findings)

2. Incident Detection:
   • SOC must continuously monitor SIEM, GuardDuty, CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs.
   • SOC alerts must be triaged within 15 minutes.
   • ASCP logs must never be disabled; tamper-events trigger alerts.

3. Incident Reporting:
   • Users must report anomalies within 15 minutes.
   • SOC must notify ISSO and ISSM immediately for confirmed incidents.
   • DFARS 252.204-7012 reporting must occur within 72 hours of discovery.

4. Containment:
   • Compromised identities/devices isolated via Conditional Access and ZTNA.
   • DevSecOps isolates impacted pods or revokes IAM roles as needed.
   • CloudOps quarantines affected AWS resources.

5. Eradication:
   • Removal of malware, unauthorized access, compromised containers, or vulnerable configurations.
   • Patching, secret rotation, or redeployment via CI/CD pipelines.

6. Recovery:
   • Restoration of services using clean images and infrastructure-as-code.
   • Validation via post-recovery testing.
   • Evidence stored in immutable S3 buckets.

7. Forensic Evidence:
   • Logs preserved for 7 years.
   • Memory captures for impacted containers (if applicable).
   • Evidence tracked and tagged as CUI.

8. Post-Incident Review:
   • Conducted by ISSM and SOC.
   • Root cause documented.
   • Remediation entered into POA&M.
   • Updates applied to training, configurations, and detection rules.

9. Communications Protocol:
   • Only designated personnel may communicate about incidents.
   • Sensitive details must not be shared outside authorized teams.

Control Alignment:
• NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 – 3.6.1 through 3.6.3.

Enforcement:
Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, access termination, or additional corrective actions.
