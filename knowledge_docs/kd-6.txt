Identification & Authentication Policy

Purpose:
This Identification & Authentication (IA) Policy establishes requirements for verifying the identity of users, service accounts, devices, and processes accessing the AegisSecure Cloud Platform (ASCP). It ensures adherence to NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 controls.

Scope:
Applies to all users, administrators, service accounts, automation processes, and devices accessing ASCP or related enclaves.

Roles & Responsibilities:
• AO – Approves major authentication exceptions.
• SO – Ensures business alignment.
• ISSM – Oversees authentication governance.
• ISSO – Manages account lifecycle and reviews authentication logs.
• Identity Admin – Manages Entra ID identities and Conditional Access.
• Keycloak Admin – Manages enclave‑level RBAC and token policies.
• DevSecOps – Enforces mTLS, service identity, and secure API authentication.
• Users – Must safeguard credentials and report suspicious activity.

Policy Statements:
1. All authentication to ASCP must occur through Entra ID GCC High, federated into Keycloak.
2. Multifactor Authentication (MFA) is mandatory using FIPS‑approved methods (hardware token or Authenticator app).
3. Devices must be fully managed, compliant, encrypted, EDR‑protected, and located in the U.S.
4. Password requirements follow Entra ID policy: 14+ characters, Smart Lockout, no reuse for 24 generations.
5. Service accounts must use OAuth2 and least‑privilege roles, with secrets rotated every 90 days.
6. Machine identities must use mTLS via service mesh (Istio) with SPIFFE IDs.
7. Break‑glass accounts must be time‑restricted, logged, monitored, and disabled after use.
8. Sessions must follow idle timeout (10 minutes) and absolute timeout (30 minutes).
9. All identities must undergo quarterly access review.
10. API access must enforce OAuth2, TLS1.2+, and no anonymous access.

Control Alignment:
NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 – 3.5.1 through 3.5.10.

Enforcement:
Failure to follow this policy may result in access revocation, disciplinary action, and incident reporting.
